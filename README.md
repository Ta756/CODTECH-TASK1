Overview of the Project: Basic Calculator in Java

The project aims to develop a console-based calculator application in Java.

This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a simple and interactive interface to input numbers, select an operation, and view the result.

Key Features of the Project:

Interactive User Experience:

Users are guided to input two numbers.

A menu is presented to choose the desired arithmetic operation.

Arithmetic Operations Supported:

Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.

Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.

Multiplication: Computes the product of two numbers.

Division: Computes the quotient of two numbers (handles division by zero).

Input Validation:

Ensures valid numeric input.

Handles incorrect menu choices and division by zero gracefully.

Reusability and Modular Design:

Uses methods for operations and displays results.

Organized code structure for easy updates or extension.

Overview of the Task:

The task involves creating a Java program that implements the following steps:

Design the Program Logic:

Outline the flow for input, processing, and output.

Include error handling for invalid inputs.

Set Up the Development Environment:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already installed.

Use an IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) for writing the code.

Implement the Code:

Create a Java class for the calculator program.

Write methods for:

Accepting user input.

Performing arithmetic operations.

Displaying results.

Include a loop to allow users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

Test the Program:

Test the calculator with various inputs (positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and invalid entries).

Verify correct handling of edge cases, such as division by zero.

Document the Code:

Add comments for each method to explain functionality.

Include usage instructions for users.

Deliverables:

A fully functional Java program that acts as a basic calculator.

Clear documentation explaining how to use the program.

A console-based user interface that provides an engaging user experience.
